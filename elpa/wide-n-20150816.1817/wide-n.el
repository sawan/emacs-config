;;; Commentary:
;;
;;    This library modifies commands `narrow-to-region',
;;    `narrow-to-defun', and `narrow-to-page' (`C-x n n', `C-x n d',
;;    and `C-x n p') so that the current buffer restriction
;;    (narrowing) is added to a list of restrictions for the current
;;    buffer, `wide-n-restrictions'.
;;
;;    You can then use `C-x n x' to cycle among previous buffer
;;    restrictions.  Repeating `x' repeats the action: `C-x n x x x x'
;;    etc.  Each time you hit `x' a different narrowing is made
;;    current.  This gives you an easy way to browse your past
;;    narrowings.
;;
;;    Invoking `C-x n x' with a prefix argument changes the behavior
;;    as follows:
;;
;;    * A plain prefix arg (`C-u') widens the buffer completely.
;;
;;    * A zero numeric prefix arg (e.g `C-0') widens completely
;;      and resets (empties) the list of restrictions.
;;
;;    * A numeric prefix arg N takes you directly to the abs(N)th
;;      previous restriction.  That is, it widens abs(N) times.
;;      Positive and negative args work the same, except that a
;;      negative arg also pops entries off the ring: it removes the
;;      ring entries from the most recent back through the (-)Nth one.
;;
;;    By default, `C-x n x' is bound to command `wide-n-repeat'.  If
;;    you use Emacs 21 then you will want to change this key binding
;;    to command `wide-n', which is a non-repeatable version.
;;    Repeatability is not available before Emacs 22.
;;
;;    The mode-line lighter `Narrow' is still used for the ordinary
;;    Emacs narrowing commands.  But for `wide-n-repeat' (`C-x n x')
;;    the current restriction is indicated in the lighter by a
;;    identifying number: `Narrow-1', `Narrow-2', and so on.
;;    `mouse-2' on the `Narrow' part still widens completely, but
;;    `mouse-2' on the `-NUM' part uses `wide-n-repeat' to cycle to
;;    the next restriction.
;;
;;    Emacs markers are used to record restriction limits, so the same
;;    restriction is available even if you modify its context.  If for
;;    any reason `wide-n-restrictions' ever has any entries that use
;;    buffer positions (numbers) instead of markers, invoking `wide-n'
;;    corrects this by changing the positions to markers.
;;
;;    This means that you can serialize `wide-n-restrictions',
;;    converting all markers to positions, save the value
;;    persistently, and restore it later.  Library `bookmark+.el' does
;;    this in order to let you bookmark and restore a list of
;;    restrictions.
;;
;;    In normal use, only the interactive use of standard commands
;;    `narrow-to-region', `narrow-to-defun', and `narrow-to-page' is
;;    affected by this library.  When these functions are called
;;    non-interactively there is normally no change to the value of
;;    variable `wide-n-restrictions'.  However, if for some reason you
;;    want to add entries to the restrictions ring when narrowing with
;;    some Emacs-Lisp code (i.e. non-interactively), you can do so by
;;    binding variable `wide-n-push-anyway-p' around the narrowing
;;    call.
;;
;;    You can use `C-x n C-d' (command `wide-n-delete') to delete a
;;    restriction, giving its number.
;;
;;    You can also add the current region to `wide-n-restrictions'
;;    without first narrowing to it, using `C-x n s' (command
;;    `wide-n-push').  You need not activate the region to do this.
;;
;;    Buffer-local variable `wide-n-restrictions' holds the
;;    restrictions for the current buffer, by default.  But the
;;    functions provided by `wide-n.el' can use any variable that
;;    holds restrictions.  And you can choose whether any such
;;    variable is buffer-local or not.  If it is not, then it can hold
;;    restrictions from multiple buffers.
;;
;;    Some commands defined here let you specify the restrictions
;;    variable to use, by prompting you if you use a prefix argument.
;;    When prompted, you can specify any variable name, even if the
;;    variable does not yet exist (in which case it is given an empty
;;    value).
;;
;;    The particular prefix arg determines whether the variable, if
;;    not yet bound, is made buffer-local, and whether
;;    `wide-n-restrictions-var' is set to the variable symbol:
;;
;;     prefix arg         buffer-local   set `wide-n-restrictions-var'
;;     ----------         ------------   -----------------------------
;;      Plain `C-u'        yes            yes
;;      > 0 (e.g. `C-1')   yes            no
;;      = 0 (e.g. `C-0')   no             yes
;;      < 0 (e.g. `C--')   no             no
;;
;;    For example, `C-u C-x n s' (`wide-n-push') prompts you for a
;;    different variable to use, in place of the current value of
;;    `wide-n-restrictions-var'.  The variable you enter is made
;;    buffer-local and it becomes the new default restrictions
;;    variable for the buffer; that is, `wide-n-restrictions-var' is
;;    set to the variable symbol.

;;    As another example, suppose that `wide-n-restrictions-var' is
;;    `wide-n-restrictions', the default value and buffer-local by
;;    design.  If you then use `C-- C-x n s' and enter a variable name
;;    at the prompt, that variable is not made buffer-local, and
;;    `wide-n-restrictions-var' is not set to that variable.  The
;;    active region is pushed to the variable, but because
;;    `wide-n-restrictions-var' is unchanged, a subsequent `C-x n s'
;;    (no prefix arg) pushes to `wide-n-restrictions'.
;;
;;    Moving among different buffer restrictions, i.e., narrowing the
;;    buffer to different zones, is one use of this library, but
;;    another important use case is performing actions on a set of
;;    buffer zones, including perhaps zones from different buffers.
;;
;;    `C-x n r' does this (command `wide-n-select-region-repeat', or
;;    `wide-n-select-region' if Emacs < 22), performing the action of
;;    selecting a zone in `wide-n-restrictions' as the region.  For
;;    Emacs 22+, you can repeat to cycle among the zones: `C-x n r r
;;    r...'.
;;
;;    You can define your own commands that iterate over the buffers
;;    and then over the entries in `wide-n-restrictions' (or some
;;    subset of them) for each buffer.  Utility functions
;;    `wide-n-limits', `wide-n-limits-in-bufs', and `wide-n-read-bufs'
;;    can help with this.
;;
;;    As examples of such commands, if you use library `highlight.el'
;;    then you can use `C-x n h' (command `hlt-highlight-regions') to
;;    highlight the restrictions recorded for the current buffer.  You
;;    can use `C-x n H' (command `hlt-highlight-regions-in-buffers')
;;    to do the same across a set of buffers that you specify (or
;;    across all visible buffers).  If option `hlt-auto-faces-flag' is
;;    non-nil then each region gets a different face.  Otherwise, all
;;    of the regions are highlighted with the same face.
;;    Complementary (unbound) commands `hlt-unhighlight-regions' and
;;    `hlt-unhighlight-regions-in-buffers' unhighlight.
;;
;;    Another way to look at the possibility of acting on multiple
;;    buffer zones is to think of it as enlarging the notion of
;;    "region".  In effect, it can remove the requirement of target
;;    text being a contiguous sequence of characters.  A set of buffer
;;    zones is, in effect, a (typically) noncontiguous "region" of
;;    text.
;;
;;    Companion library `zones.el' provides utility functions for
;;    buffer zones.  It is not strictly required by `wide-n.el', but
;;    you need it if you want to use commands `wide-n-unite' and
;;    `wide-n-add-to-union'.  These commands coalesce overlapping and
;;    contiguous zones, uniting them as a single zone.
;;
;;    Pretty much anything you can do with the Emacs region you can do
;;    with a set of buffer restrictions (a non-contiguous "region",
;;    `wide-n-restrictions').  But existing Emacs commands that act on
;;    the region do not know about non-contiguous regions.  What you
;;    will need to do is define new commands that take these into
;;    account.
;;
;;    This can be simple or somewhat complex, depending on how the
;;    region is used in the code for the corresponding region-action
;;    Emacs command.  The definition of `hlt-highlight-regions' just
;;    calls existing function `hlt-highlight-region' once for each
;;    recorded region:
;;
;; (defun hlt-highlight-regions (&optional regions face msgp mousep
;;                                         buffers)
;;   "Apply `hlt-highlight-region' to regions in `wide-n-restrictions'."
;;   (interactive (list (wide-n-limits) nil t current-prefix-arg))
;;   (dolist (start+end  regions)
;;     (hlt-highlight-region (nth 0 start+end) (nth 1 start+end)
;;                           face msgp mousep buffers)))
;;    
;;    That's it - just iterate over `wide-n-restrictions' with a
;;    function that takes the region as an argument.  What `wide-n.el'
;;    offers in this regard is a way to easily define a set of buffer
;;    restrictions.
