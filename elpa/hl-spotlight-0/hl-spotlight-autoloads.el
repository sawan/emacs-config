Buffer-local minor mode to highlight lines surrounding point.
With ARG, turn Hl-Spotlight mode on if ARG is positive, off otherwise.

Hl-Spotlight mode uses Hl-Line mode.  Whenever Hl-Spotlight mode is on
in the current buffer, its overlay is used by Hl-Line mode, which
means that face `hl-spotlight' and option `hl-spotlight-height' are
used; face `hl-line' is not used.

Turn the spotlight on and off by using toggle command
`hl-spotlight-mode'.  After turning Hl-Spotlight mode on, command
`hl-line-mode' also toggles the spotlight on and off, but without
turning off Hl-Spotlight mode.  To return to the normal behavior of
`hl-line-mode', you must turn off Hl-Spotlight mode.  Turning off
Hl-Spotlight mode also turns off Hl-Line mode.

Scan the buffer, moving the cursor down automatically.

line or the number of lines specified by a prefix arg.  Scanning
starts at point.

With a plain prefix arg (`C-u'), stop a scan already in progess.

With a numeric prefix arg, scan down that many lines.
A negative prefix arg means scan up, not down.
With `C-u C-u', scan down the height of a full spotlight.
