(autoload 'hydra-create "hydra" "\
Create a hydra with a BODY prefix and HEADS with METHOD.
This will result in `global-set-key' statements with the keys
being the concatenation of BODY and each head in HEADS.  HEADS is
an list of (KEY FUNCTION &optional HINT).

After one of the HEADS is called via BODY+KEY, it and the other
HEADS can be called with only KEY (no need for BODY).  This state
is broken once any key binding that is not in HEADS is called.

METHOD is a lambda takes two arguments: a KEY and a COMMAND.
It defaults to `global-set-key'.
When `(keymapp METHOD)`, it becomes:

    (lambda (key command) (define-key METHOD key command))

\(fn BODY HEADS &optional METHOD)" nil t)

(put 'hydra-create 'lisp-indent-function '1)

(autoload 'defhydra "hydra" "\
Create a hydra named NAME with a prefix BODY.

NAME should be a symbol, it will be the prefix of all functions
defined here.

BODY should be either:

    (BODY-MAP &optional BODY-KEY &rest PLIST)
or:

    (lambda (KEY CMD) ...)

BODY-MAP should be a keymap; `global-map' is acceptable here.
BODY-KEY should be a string processable by `kbd'.

DOCSTRING will be displayed in the echo area to identify the
hydra.

HEADS is a list of (KEY CMD &optional HINT &rest PLIST).

PLIST in both cases recognizes only the :color key so far, which
in turn can be either red or blue.
